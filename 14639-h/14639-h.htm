    <h3>CHARIVARIA.</h3>

    <p>One of the latest peculiarities of the KAISER is an absolute
    horror at the thought of being prematurely buried. Several
    experts however say that this is impossible.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It appears that HINDENBURG accuses the CROWN PRINCE OF
    BAVARIA of having misunderstood an order, thus losing
    Grandcourt for the Germans. RUPPRECHT, we understand, retorted
    that the real culprits were the British.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>In a character-sketch of VON BISSING, the <i>Cologne
    Gazette</i> says, "He is a fine musician and his execution is
    good." It would be.</p>

        <h4>THE PAPER SHORTAGE.</h4>

        <p><i>News Editor of</i> "<i>Daily Bugle Blast</i>." "JUST
        TYPE A SHORT NOTICE THAT FINDERS OF FIRST SNOWDROP, CROCUS,
        PRIMROSE OR ANY EARLY SPRING PHENOMENA MUST APPRISE WORLD
        THROUGH OUR ADVERTISEMENT COLUMNS."</p>
    </div>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>No German submarine, says ADMIRAL VON CAPELLE, has been lost
    since the beginning of the submarine war. This assurance has
    been received with the liveliest satisfaction by several U-boat
    commanders who have been in the awkward predicament of not
    knowing whether they were officially missing.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Captain BOY ED is stated to have returned to the United
    States disguised. Not on this occasion, we may assume, as an
    officer and a gentleman.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>According to the ex-Portuguese Consul at Hamburg bone
    tickets are issued for making soup, but the bone must be
    returned to the authorities. Possibly the hardship of the
    procedure would be mitigated if ticket-holders were permitted
    to growl.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A metallurgical engineer at the Surbiton Tribunal said he
    was forty-one years old, and only missed the age-limit by
    eighteen hours. It is not thought that he did it purposely.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>At the Billericay Tribunal an applicant last week stated
    that he had nine children, but upon counting them again he
    discovered that he had ten. There seems to be no excuse for
    this sort of thing, for Adding machines are now fairly well
    advertised.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Discussing the latest dress fashion, a lady writer says, "It
    is a most ridiculous dress. Nothing worse could be conceived."
    This, of course, is foolish talk, for the lady has not seen
    next season's style.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Austrian tobacconists are now prohibited from selling more
    than one cigar a day to a customer. To conserve the supply
    still further it is proposed to compel the tobacconist to offer
    each customer the alternative of nuts.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"When I see a map of the British Empire," said Mr. PONSONBY,
    M.P., "I do not feel any pride whatsoever." People have been
    known to express similar sentiments upon sighting certain
    M.P.'s.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"The public must hold up the policeman's hands," said a
    London magistrate in a recent traffic case. It is astonishing
    how some policeman are able to hold them up without assistance
    for several seconds at a time.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The staff of the new Pensions Minister, it is announced,
    will be over two thousand. It is still hoped, however, that
    there may be a small surplus which can be devoted to the needs
    of disabled soldiers.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Several men have been arrested in Dresden for passing
    counterfeit food tickets. The defence will presumably be that
    it wasn't real food.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The Royal Engineers are advertising for seamen for the
    Inland Water Transport Section. The Chief Transport Officer, we
    understand, has already hoisted his bargee.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Eggs to the number of six million odd have just arrived from
    China, says a news item, and will be used for confectionery.
    Had they arrived three months ago nothing could have averted a
    General Election.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A hen while being sold at a Red Cross sale at Horsham laid
    an egg which fetched 35<i>s.</i> In the best hen circles, where
    steady silent work is being done, there is a growing tendency
    to frown upon these isolated acts of ostentatious
    patriotism.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>The Times</i>, it seems, has not published a complete
    list of its rivals in the desperate struggle for the smallest
    circulation. A Finchley Church magazine has increased its price
    to 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> a copy.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Paper bags are no longer being used by greengrocers in
    Bangor, and their customers are patriotically assisting this
    economy by unpodding their green peas and rolling them
    home.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"Bacon, as a breakfast food," says an evening paper, "is
    fast disappearing from the table." We have often noticed it do
    so.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"It is pitiful and disgraceful," says the <i>Berliner
    Tageblatt</i>, "to watch women-folk walking beside their
    half-starved dogs. There is no room in warfare for dogs." We
    have all along felt sorry for the poor animals at a time when
    one half the dachshund does not know how the other half
    lives.</p>

    <h3>THE BROKEN SOLDIERS.</h3>

    <p>"Now," I suggested as we left the drapery department,
    "you've got as much as you can carry." Unfortunately it was
    impossible to relieve her of the parcels as I had all my work
    cut out to manipulate those confounded crutches.</p>

    <p>"There's only the toy department," returned Pamela, leading
    the way with her armful of packages. "I do hope you're not
    frightfully tired." Of course it seemed ridiculous, but I had
    not been out of hospital many days, and as yet I had not grown
    used to stumping about in this manner.</p>

    <p>"Do you happen," asked Pamela at the counter, "to have such
    a thing as a box of broken soldiers?"</p>

    <p>The young woman looked astonished and even a little hurt,
    but offered, with condescension, to inquire.</p>

    <p>"Do you want them for Dick?" I asked, Dick being Pamela's
    youngest brother.</p>

    <p>"For Dick and Alice," said Pamela. Alice was her sister,
    younger still.</p>

    <p>"Why shouldn't I buy them a box of whole ones?"</p>

    <p>"That wouldn't answer the purpose. They have three large
    boxes already," answered Pamela, as a young man appeared in a
    frock coat, with a silver badge on the right lapel, "For
    Services Rendered." In his hand was a dusty cardboard box, and
    in the box lay five damaged leaden soldiers, up-to-date
    soldiers in khaki; two without heads, two armless, one who had
    lost both legs.</p>

    <p>"Those will do splendidly," said Pamela, and the young man
    with the silver badge obligingly put the soldiers into my tunic
    pocket. It seemed to be understood that they and I had been
    knocked out in the same campaign.</p>

    <p>"Why," I asked on the way home in the taxi, "did you want
    the soldiers to be broken?"</p>

    <p>"I&mdash;I didn't," murmured Pamela, with a sigh.</p>

    <p>"Why did Dick?" I persisted.</p>

    <p>"The children are so dreadfully realistic now-a-days. You
    see, Father objected to his breaking heads and arms off his new
    ones. Dick was quite rebellious. He wanted to know what he was
    to do for wounded; and Alice was more disappointed still."</p>

    <p>"I should have thought it was too painful a notion for her,"
    I suggested.</p>

    <p>"Oh!" cried Pamela, with a laugh, "Alice is a Red Cross
    nurse, you know. She's made a hospital out of a Noah's Ark. She
    only thinks of healing them."</p>

    <p>"All the King's horses and all the King's men cannot put
    Humpty Dumpty together again," I said.</p>

    <p>"Poor old boy!" whispered Pamela.</p>

    <p>"I wonder whether broken soldiers have an interest for you
    as well," I remarked ... and Dick and Alice were completely
    forgotten until they met us clamorously in the hall.</p>

    <p>"Did you get any, Pam?" cried Dick.</p>

    <p>"Only five," was the answer, as I took the small paper
    parcel from my pocket and handed it over.</p>

    <p>"Is that all?" demanded Alice.</p>

    <p>"There's one more," I said.</p>

    <p>"Is that for me?" cried Alice; but Pamela shook her head and
    smiled very nicely as she took my arm.</p>

    <p>"No, that's for me," she said.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>A TRAGEDY OF THE SEA.</h3>

    <p>The night was a very dark one, for a cold damp fog hung over
    the Channel. The few lights we carried reflected in-board only,
    and, leaning over the rail, it was with difficulty that I could
    distinguish the dark waters washing below. Shore-ward I could
    see nothing, though I knew that a good-sized town lay
    there.</p>

    <p>I had soon had enough of the inclement night. Keeping my
    feet with some difficulty upon the wet boards, I groped my way
    to a door and, pushing it open, entered.</p>

    <p>A strange scene met my gaze. A spruce man in the uniform of
    a naval officer was seated at a table. Before him stood a tall
    well-set-up young seaman. His dishevelled head was hatless, but
    otherwise he looked trim, and his garments fitted him better
    than a seaman's garments generally do. On each side of him
    stood an armed guard.</p>

    <p>"Have you anything to say for yourself?" asked the officer
    sternly.</p>

    <p>"No, Sir, only that I am innocent," answered the man. He
    held his head high, almost defiantly. I could not but admire
    his courageous bearing, and yet there was an air of unreality
    about the whole thing. I felt almost as if I were dreaming it,
    but I knew that this was not a dream.</p>

    <p>"The evidence against you is overwhelming," said the
    officer. "I have no alternative but to sentence you to death.
    The sentence will be carried out at dawn. Remove the
    prisoner."</p>

    <p>The seaman took a step forward. For a moment he seemed to be
    struggling with himself, anxious to speak, yet forcing himself
    to silence. Then he bowed his head, and, turning, placed
    himself between the guards and was marched away.</p>

    <p>The officer sighed. "It's a bad business," he said. "He's
    the best man I ever had on my ship."</p>

    <p>He was speaking to himself, and again I had that strange
    sense of unreality, as indeed I well might, for this was the
    Third Act of <i>True to the Death</i>, a melodrama in the
    pavilion at the end of the pier.</p>

        <h2>THE RETORT CELESTIAL.</h2>

        <p>[China has threatened to break off relations with the
        German Government on account of its barbarity. It will be
        recalled that the KAISER once designed an allegorical

    <h3>WEATHER-VANES.</h3>

    <p>It was 2 A.M. The mosquitoes were singing their nightly
    chorus, and the situation reports were coming in from the
    battalions in the line. With his hair sizzling in the flame of
    the candle, the Brigade Orderly Officer who was on duty for the
    night tried to decipher the feathery scrawl on the pink
    form.</p>

    <p>"Situation normal A-A-A wind moderate N.E.," it read.</p>

    <p>"Great Scott!" said the O.O. "North-East!" (Hun gas waits
    upon a wind with East in it). "Give me the message book."</p>

    <p>Laboriously he wrote out warnings to the battalions and
    machine gun sections, etc., under the Brigade's control. Then
    he turned to the next message.</p>

    <p>"Situation normal A-A-A wind light S.W."</p>

    <p>"South-West?" said the O.O. blankly, viewing his now useless
    handiwork. "Which way <i>is</i> the wind then?"</p>

    <p>The orderly went out to see, and returned presently with a
    moistened forefinger and the information that it was "blowing
    acrossways, leastways it seemed like it." The O.O. got out of
    his little wire bed, searched in his pyjamas for the North
    Star, and, finally deciding that if there was any wind at all
    (which was doubtful) it was due South, reported it as such. The
    responsibility incurred kept him awake for some time, but when
    the Brigade on the right flank reported a totally different
    wind he concluded there must be a whirlwind in the line, and,
    putting up a barrage of bad language, went to sleep.</p>

    <p>In due course the matter came to the ears of the Staff
    Captain, who broached the subject at breakfast as the General
    was probing his second poached egg.</p>

    <p>"This," said the General, who is rather given to the
    vernacular, "is the limit. A North-South-East-West report is
    preposterous. Something must be done. Haven't we got a
    weather-vane of our own? Pass the marmalade, will you?"</p>

    <p>Four people reached hastily for the delicacy, and the O.O.
    feeling out of it passed the milk for no reason. (Generals
    really get a very good time. People have been known to pass
    things to them unasked.)</p>

    <p>"What about those two vanes in our last headquarters, Sir?"
    said the Staff Captain brightly&mdash;he is very bright and
    bird-like in the mornings&mdash;"the ones the padre thought
    were Russian fire-guards. Can't we get them? They aren't ours,
    but then they aren't anybody's&mdash;they've been there a year,
    the old woman told me."</p>

    <p>"Where's the Orderly Officer?" (He was there with a mouthful
    of toast.) "Take the mess limber and fetch 'em back if the
    Heavy Group Artillery will let you&mdash;they're in there now,
    aren't they?"</p>

    <p>"And if you're g-going into the town g-get some fish for
    dinner," said the Brigade Major; "everlasting ration beef makes
    my s-stammer worse."</p>

    <p>"Why?" said the General.</p>

    <p>"Indigestion&mdash;nerves, Sir; I can hardly talk over the
    telephone at all after dinner."</p>

    <p>"Good heavens!" said the General; "bring a turbot."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"Fish!" said the B.M. at dinner. "Bong!"</p>

    <p>"I brought the vanes, Sir."</p>

    <p>"Have any
    trouble?"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page137"
       id="page137"></a>[pg 137]</span>

    <p>"No, Sir. I saw the A.D.C., and said we had 'left them
    behind,' which was true, you know, Sir." (The O.O. for once
    felt himself the centre of interest and desired to improve the
    occasion). "We <i>did</i> 'leave them behind,' so it wasn't a
    lie exactly ..."</p>

    <p>"I don't care if it was," said the General; "you've got 'em,
    that's the main thing."</p>

    <p>"Where will you have one put, Sir?"</p>

    <p>"In the fields," said the B.M.</p>

    <p>"Not too low," said the Captain.</p>

    <p>"Or too high," said Signals.</p>

    <p>"Or too far away," said the attached officer.</p>

    <p>"Well, now you know," said the General, "pass the
    chutney."</p>

    <p>They all passed it as well as several other things until he
    was thoroughly dug-in.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"Another N.S.E.W. report, Sir," said the Staff Captain next
    morning.</p>

    <p>"&mdash;&mdash;!" said the General. (I think I mentioned his
    partiality for the vernacular). "Where's our vane?"</p>

    <p>"It's up, Sir," said the O.O., shining proudly again, "and
    I&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"We'll have' a look at it," and out they all
    went&mdash;General, Brigade Major (enunciating pedantically
    after a fish breakfast), Staff Captain (bright and birdlike),
    and the O.O. It was a brilliant spectacle.</p>

    <p>"North is&mdash;there!" said the General in his best
    field-day manner, "and this is pointing&mdash;due East!" He
    touched the vane gently. It did not budge. He touched it again.
    A cold sweat broke out on the forehead of the O.O.</p>

    <p>"Paralysed," said the B.M.</p>

    <p>"Give it a 'stand-east,' Sir," said the Staff Captain.</p>

    <p>"It's stiff!" said the General; "wants-oil" (pause); "wants
    <i>oil</i>!" and the O.O. slid away, returning at once with oil
    (salad, bottle, one).</p>

    <p>"Now pour it over the top&mdash;top, boy, top!"</p>

    <p>A flood sprayed over the top flange, and the B.M. searched
    hastily for a handkerchief.</p>

    <p>"Making a salad of you?" said the General. "Ha! ha!"</p>

    <p>The B.M. smiled a smile (sickly, one).</p>

    <p>"That's better!" The General spun it round. "What's it say
    now? East!"</p>

    <p>"Better wait," said the B.M., "it'll change its mind in a
    minute."</p>

    <p>"It's going!" cried the General excitedly. "There! Well,
    I'm&mdash;West!"</p>

    <p>"The padre was right&mdash;it must be a fireguard, after
    all," said the Staff Captain.</p>

    <p>"Or a s-sundial," muttered the B.M.</p>

    <p>I believe the meteorological report was finally entered as:
    "Wind light to moderate (to strong), varying from East to West
    (<i>via</i> North and South)."</p>

    <p>"Of course," said the General kindly to the O.O., "it's not
    quite perpendicular, it's a bit too low; wants a stronger prop,
    wires are a bit slack, the vane itself wants looking to, and
    the whole thing is in rather a bad position, but otherwise it's
    all right&mdash;quite all right."</p>

    <p>"Yes, Sir," said the O.O.</p>

    <p>"And there's too much oil," added the General, as he moved
    off.</p>

    <p>"There is," said the B.M., discovering
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page138"
       id="page138"></a>[pg 138]</span> another blob on his shiny
       boots, "and on m-me!"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>The Staff were unaccountably late. The O.O. breakfasted
    alone. For three days he had been the despair of the small and
    perspiring body of pioneers, who towards the end had fled at
    the mere sight of him. But at last the vane was working.</p>

    <p>"Well," said the General when he came in, "how's the wind,
    expert?"</p>

    <p>"N.N.E.," said the O.O. proudly. (It was the first thing he
    had done since he came on the Brigade three weeks before, and
    he was pleased at the interest the Staff had taken in his
    little achievement.) "I've had the pioneers working on it, and
    we've got it up another four feet, Sir, tightened the pole, and
    wired it on to the supports on every side. It's quite
    perpendicular now. I've marked out the points of the compass on
    it, and fixed up a little arrangement for gauging the strength
    of the wind&mdash;that flap thing, you know, Sir&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Yes, yes," said the General, who seemed to have lost his
    first keenness, "I'm glad it's working all right. By the way,
    we shall be moving from here to-morrow; the division's going
    back."</p>

    <p>The O.O. drained the teapot in silence, and was glad it was
    strong and bitter.</p>

    <h3>INFORMATION WANTED.</h3>

    <p>No one can answer the question, and I have not the
    pluck&mdash;being a law-abiding citizen&mdash;to try for
    myself. But I do so want to know. I ask everyone. I ask my
    partners at dinner (when any dinner comes my way). I ask casual
    acquaintances. I would ask the officials themselves, only they
    are so preoccupied. But the words certainly set up a very
    engrossing problem, and upon this problem many minor problems
    depend, clustering round it like chickens round the maternal
    hen. But I should be quite content with an answer only to the
    hen; the rest could wait. Yet there is an inter-dependence
    between them that cannot be overlooked. For example, did
    someone once do it and meet with such a calamity that everyone
    else had to be warned? Or is it merely that the authorities
    dislike us to be comfy? Or is it thought that the public might
    get so much attracted by the habit as to convert the place into
    a house where a dance is in progress? I wish I knew these
    things.</p>

    <p>Will not some Member ask for information in the House, and
    then&mdash;arising out of this question&mdash;get all the other
    subsidiary facts? We are told so many things that don't matter,
    such as the enormous number of Ministers in the new Government,
    which was formed, if I remember rightly, as a protest against
    too large a Cabinet; such as the colossal genius of each and
    every performer in Mr. COCHRANE'S theatrical companies; such as
    the best place in Oxford Street to contract the shopping habit;
    such as the breaks made day by day all through the War by
    billiard champions; such as the departure of Mr. G.B. SHAW on
    his bewildering and, one would think, totally unnecessary visit
    to the Front and his return from that experience; such
    as&mdash;but enough. I am told by the informative Press all
    these and more things, but no one tells me the one thing I want
    to know.</p>

    <p>Perhaps YOU can.</p>

    <p>I want to know why we may not sit on the Tube moving
    staircases, and I want to know what would happen if we did.</p>

    <h3>PROBLEMS FOR P&Eacute;TROLEUSES.</h3>

    <p>The Metropolitan Commissioner of Police having decided to
    sanction women taxicab drivers, we understand that all
    applicants for licences will be required to pass a severe
    examination in "knowledge of London." As, however, this will be
    concerned mainly with localities and quickest routes, we
    venture to suggest to the examiners a few supplementary
    questions of a more general character:&mdash;</p>

    <p>(I.) How far should a cab-wheel revolving at fifteen miles
    an hour, be able to fling a pint of London mud?</p>

    <p>(II.) Has a pedestrian any right to cross a road? and, if
    so, how much?</p>

    <p>(III.) With three toots of an ordinary motor-horn indicate
    the following:&mdash;(<i>a</i>) contempt, (<i>b</i>) rage,
    (<i>c</i>) homicidal mania.</p>

    <p>(IV.) Under what circumstances, if any, should the words
    "Thank you" be employed?</p>

    <p>(V.) Having been engaged at 11.35 P.M. to drive an elderly
    gentleman, wearing a fur-coat, to Golder's Green, you are
    tendered the legal fare plus twopence. Express, within ladylike
    limits, your appreciation of this generosity.</p>

    <p>(VI.) On subsequently discovering the same gentleman to be a
    member of the Petrol Control Committee, revise your answer
    accordingly.</p>

    <p>(VII.) Sketch, within ten sheets of MS., your idea of a

   <p><i>Monday, February 19th</i>.&mdash;The CHANCELLOR OF THE
    EXCHEQUER announced that the "new money" subscribed for the War
    Loan amounted to at least seven hundred millions. Being a
    modest man he refrained from saying, "A loan, I did it," though
    it was largely due to his faith in the generosity and good
    sense of his fellow-citizens that the rate of interest was not
    more onerous to the State.</p>

    <p>Mr. LYNCH thinks it would be a good idea if Ireland were
    specially represented at the Peace Conference, in order that
    her delegates might assert her right to self-government. I dare
    say, if pressed, he would be prepared to nominate at least one
    of her representatives. Having regard to the Nationalist
    attitude towards military service Mr. BALFOUR might have
    retorted that only belligerents would be represented at the
    Peace Conference, but he contented himself with a simple
    negative.</p>

    <p>There is an erroneous impression that Mr. LLOYD GEORGE sits
    in his private room scheming out new Departments and murmuring
    like the gentleman in the advertisement of the elastic
    bookcase, "How beautifully it grows!" Up to the present,
    however, there are only thirty-three actual Ministers of the
    Crown, not counting such small fry as Under-Secretaries, and
    their salaries merely amount to the trifle of &pound;133,500.
    It is pleasant to learn that a branch of the Shipping
    Controller's department is appropriately housed in the Lake
    Dwellings in St. James's Park; and, in view of Mr. KING'S
    objection that the members of the Secret Service with whom he
    has come into contact make no sort of secret about their
    business (one pictures them confiding in this gentleman), it is
    expected that the Board of Works will shortly commandeer a
    strip of Tube Railway to conceal them in.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, February 20th</i>.&mdash;In one respect the two
    representatives of the War Office in the House of Commons are
    singularly alike. When answering their daily catechism both
    wear spectacles&mdash;Mr. FORSTER an ordinary gold-rimmed pair,
    Mr. MACPHERSON the fearsome tortoise-shell variety which gives
    an air of antiquity to the most youthful countenance; and each,
    when he has to answer an awkward "supplementary," begins by
    carefully taking off his glasses and so giving himself an extra
    moment or two to frame a telling reply.</p>

    <p>This afternoon Mr. MACPHERSON'S spectacles were on and off
    half-a-dozen times as he withstood an assault directed from
    various quarters against the refusal of the War Office to admit
    the profession of "manipulative surgery" to the Army Medical
    Service. In vain he was informed of wonderful cures effected by
    this means on generals and admirals, and even members of the
    Government; in vain Mr. LYNCH sought from him an admission that
    the life of one private soldier was more valuable than that of
    the two Front Benches put together. All these attempts at
    manipulative surgery quite failed to reduce Mr. MACPHERSON'S
    obstinate stiff neck; and at last the SPEAKER had to intervene
    to stop the treatment.</p>

    <p>The persistence with which a little knot of Members below
    the Gangway advances the proposition that all Germany is
    longing to make an honourable peace, and that it is only the
    insatiate ambition of the Allies which stands in the way, would
    be pathetic if it were not mischievous. Mr. PONSONBY,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page143"
       id="page143"></a>[pg 143]</span> Mr. TREVELYAN, and Mr.
       SNOWDEN once more argued this hopeless case with a good deal
       of varied ability. A small house listened politely, but was
       more impressed by a masterly expos&eacute; of the facts by
       Mr. RONALD M'NEILL, and an Imperialist slogan by Sir HAMAR
       GREENWOOD; while later in the debate Mr. BONAR LAW restated
       the national aims in the War with a cogency that drew from
       Mr. SAMUEL a generous pledge "on behalf of those who sit
       opposite the Government" to give Ministers their
       whole-hearted support.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, February 21st</i>.&mdash;The House learned
    with satisfaction that crews of our river gun-boats in
    Mesopotamia are to get their hard-lying money; and when the
    authors of the Turkish <i>communiqu&eacute;s</i> hear of it
    they are expected to put in a similar claim.</p>

    <p>Lord FISHER was in his customary place over the
    Clock&mdash;his friends all tell us that he is superior to
    Time; Lord BERESFORD was at a suitable&mdash;I had almost said
    respectful&mdash;distance from him in the Peers' Gallery; and
    conspicuous among the Distinguished Strangers was Sir JOHN
    JELLICOE. They and all of us listened intently while for over
    an hour Sir EDWARD CARSON, now as much at home on the
    quarter-deck as ever he was at quarter sessions, discoursed
    eloquently and frankly on the wonderful and never-ending work
    of the Senior Service.</p>

    <p>He did not underestimate the danger of the submarines, or
    pretend that the Admiralty had yet discovered any sovran remedy
    for their attacks. Nor could he say&mdash;for reasons which
    seemed to satisfy the House&mdash;how many of them had already
    been captured or sunk. But he told us enough to convict Admiral
    VON CAPELLE, who was at that moment declaring that not a single
    U-boat had been lost since the opening of the new campaign, of
    being either singularly misinformed or highly imaginative.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday, February 22nd</i>.&mdash;A strange sympathy
    seems to exist between the SPEAKER and Mr. GINNELL. Each, I
    fancy, has a soft spot somewhere. Mr. LOWTHER'S is in his
    heart, and makes him go out of his way to help the wayward
    Member for North Westmeath. Mr. GINNELL, whose soft spot seems
    to be higher up, wanted to show that he did not approve of Mr.
    MACPHERSON, and called him an impertinent Minister. Ordered to
    withdraw the expression, he substituted "impudent." That would
    not do either, and there seemed danger of a deadlock and
    another expulsion until Mr. LOWTHER suggested that "incorrect"
    was a Parliamentary epithet which might suit the hon. Member's
    purpose. Mr. GINNELL handsomely accepted this variation in the
    spirit in which it was offered.</p>

    <p>Sir GEORGE CAVE is the Ministerial maid-of-all-work.
    Whenever there is a disagreeable or awkward measure to
    introduce it falls to the Quite-at-Home Secretary, if I may
    borrow an expression coined by my friend, TOBY, M.P., for one
    of Sir GEORGE'S predecessors. So judiciously did he accentuate
    the good points and soften the possible asperities of the
    National Service Bill that even Sir CHARLES HOBHOUSE, who had
    come to condemn, remained to bless.</p>

    <p><i>Friday, February 23rd</i>.&mdash;Owing to a variety of
    causes, we are short of tonnage, and unless we manage to grow
    more and consume less we shall before very long be within reach
    of the gaunt finger of Famine. That was the burden of the PRIME
    MINISTER'S appeal to the Nation. The farmer is to have a
    guaranteed minimum price for his produce, the agricultural
    labourer is to be raised to comparative affluence by a minimum
    wage of 25<i>s.</i> a week, and the rest of us are to go
    without most of our imported luxuries and a good many
    necessities. So impressed were Members by the gloominess of the
    prospect that the moment the speech was over they rushed out to
    secure what they felt might be their last really substantial
    luncheon, and Mr. DAVID MASON, who had nobly essayed to fill
    the breach caused by Mr. ASQUITH'S absence, was soon talking to
    empty benches.</p>

    <h3>THE COMPLIMENT.</h3>

    <p>We all know the man with a grievance and avoid him. But
    there is another man with a grievance whom I rather like, and
    this is his story. I must, of course, let him tell it in the
    first-person-singular, because otherwise what is the use of
    having a grievance at all? The first-person-singular narrative
    form is the grievance's compensation. Listen.</p>

    <p>"I am an old Oxonian who joined the Royal Naval Division as
    an ordinary seaman not long after the outbreak of the War, and
    being perhaps not too physically vigorous and having a certain
    rhetorical gift, developed at the Union, I was told off, after
    some months' training, to take part in a recruiting campaign.
    We pursued the usual tactics. First a trumpeter awakened the
    neighbourhood, very much as Mr. HAWTREY is aroused from his
    coma in his delightful new play, and then the people drew
    round. One by one we mounted whatever rostrum there was&mdash;a
    drinking fountain, say&mdash;and spoke our little piece, urging
    the claims of country.</p>

    <p>"As a rule the audience was either errand-boys, girls or old
    men; but we did our best.</p>

    <p>"Sometimes, however, there would be an evening meeting in a
    public building, and then the proceedings were more formal and
    pretentious. The trumpeter disappeared and a chairman would
    open the ball. The occasion of which I am thinking was one of
    these meetings in the East End, where the Chairman was a local
    tradesman. He said that this was a war for liberty and that
    England could never sheathe the sword until Belgium was free;
    he told the audience how many of his relations were fighting;
    and then he made way for our gallant boys in blue who were to
    address the company.</p>

    <p>"Well, we addressed the company, I by no means the least of
    the orators, and then the Chairman wound up the meeting. He
    said how much he had enjoyed the speeches and how much he hoped
    that they would bear good fruit; and indeed he felt confident
    of that, because 'we 'ere in the East End are plain
    straight-forward folk, who like plain straight-forward talk,
    and we would rather listen to the honest 'omely sailors who
    'ave been talking to us this evening, than any fine Oxford
    gentleman.'"</p>

    <p>That is the story of my friend with a grievance. And yet,
    now I come to think about it again, and his manner of telling
    it, I'm not sure I ought not rather to call him a man with a
    triumph.</p>

    <h3>HELPING LORD DEVONPORT.</h3>

    <p>"Francesca," I said, "what are you doing to help Lord
    DEVONPORT?"</p>

    <p>"Lots of things," she said. "For one thing, we're living
    under his ration-scheme, and we're doing it pretty well, thank
    you."</p>

    <p>"Yes, I know," I said; "I've heard you mention it once or
    twice. It seems to consist very largely of rissoles and that
    kind of food."</p>

    <p>"Well," she said, "we must use up everything; and, besides,
    you'd soon get tired of beefsteak if I gave it to you every
    day."</p>

    <p>"Tired of beefsteak?" I said. "Never. The toughest steak
    would always be a joy to me."</p>

    <p>"I've come to the conclusion," she said, "that men really
    like their eatables tough."</p>

    <p>"Yes, they want something they can bite into, you know."</p>

    <p>"But you can't bite into our beefsteak, now can you?"</p>

    <p>"Perhaps not," I said, "but you can't help feeling it's
    there, which is a great help when you're being rationed."</p>

    <p>"That," she said, "may be all very well for a man, but women
    don't care for that feeling. They like their food light but
    stimulating."</p>

    <p>"They do," I said, "and they prefer it all brought in on one
    tray and at irregular hours. Lord DEVONPORT'S scheme is to them
    a sort of wicked abundance. To a man it is&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Plenty and to spare," she said. "Why, you won't have to
    tighten your belt even by one hole. Now admit, if you hadn't
    known you were being rationed you'd never have found it
    out."</p>

    <p>"I will admit," I said, "that if the privations we have
    suffered this last week in the matter of beefsteaks and that
    kind of food are the worst that can happen to us we shan't have
    much to complain of&mdash;but I should like a chop to-night
    instead of a rissole."</p>

    <p>"You can call it a chop if you like, but it's going to be a
    cutlet."</p>

    <p>"Well, anyhow," I said, "we don't seem to be doing as much
    as we might for Lord DEVONPORT."</p>

    <p>"You're wrong," she said; "I'm keeping hens in the
    stable-yard."</p>

    <p>"Hens? What do you know about hens?"</p>

    <p>"For the matter of that, what do you?"</p>

    <p>"That's not the question," I said, "but I'll answer it all
    the same. I know that most hens are called Buff Orpingtons, and
    that they never lay any eggs unless you put a china egg in
    their nest just to coax them along and rouse their ambition.
    Francesca, have you put a china egg where our Buff Orpingtons
    can see it?"</p>

    <p>"Frederick is looking after these domestic details. He seems
    to think that if he goes to the hen-house every ten minutes or
    so the laying of eggs will be promoted. Won't you go round with
    him next time?"</p>

    <p>"No," I said, "I've never seen a hen lay an egg yet, and I'm
    not going to begin at my time of life. Besides, I've already
    said they never lay eggs even when you don't watch them."</p>

    <p>"Wrong again," she said. "We got one egg this morning."</p>

    <p>"Francesca," I said, "this <i>is</i> exciting. Did the happy
    mother announce the event to the world in the usual way?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, she screamed and cackled for about a
    quarter-of-an-hour, and Frederick came along and seized the
    subject of her rejoicing. You're going to have it to-night,
    boiled, instead of soup and fish."</p>

    <p>"Isn't that splendid?" I said. "At this rate we shall soon
    be self-supporting, and then we can snap our fingers at Lord
    DEVONPORT."</p>

    <p>"I never snap my fingers," she said. "No well-brought-up
    hen-keeper ever does. Besides, it's our duty to help the
    Government all we can, so that Lord DEVONPORT may have so much
    more to play with."</p>

    <p>"Why should he want to play with it?" I said. "He doesn't
    strike me as being that kind of man at all."</p>

    <p>"I daresay he plays in his off-hours."</p>

    <p>"A man like that," I said, "hasn't any off-hours. He's
    chin-deep in his work."</p>

    <p>"Anyhow," she said, "I should like him to know that we're
    pulling up the herbaceous border and planting it with potatoes,
    and that we've started keeping hens, and that we've already got
    one egg, and that when the time comes we shall not lack for
    chicken, roast or boiled."</p>

    <p>"Francesca," I said, "how can you allude so flippantly to
    the tragedies which are inseparable from the possession of Buff
    Orpingtons? In the morning a young bird struts about in his
    pride, resolved to live his life fearlessly and to salute the
    dawn at any and every hour before the break of day. Then
    something happens: a gardener, a family man not naturally
    ruthless, comes upon the scene; there is a short but terrible
    struggle; a neck (not the gardener's) is wrung, and there is
    chicken for dinner."</p>

    <p>"Don't move me," she said, "to tears, or I shall have to
    countermand your egg. Besides, I don't think I could ever make
    a real friend of a fowl. They've got such silly ways and their
    eyes are so beady."</p>

    <p>"Their ways are not sillier nor are their eyes beadier than
    our Mrs. Burwell's, yet she is honoured as a pillar of
    propriety, while they&mdash;no matter; I hope the chicken when
    its moment comes will be tender and succulent."</p>

    <p>"Hark!" said Francesca.</p>

    <p>"Yes," I said, "another egg has come into the world, and
    there's Frederick rushing round like a mad thing with a basket,
    to find himself once more too late. Never mind," I said, "I can
    have two boiled eggs to-night with my chop,&mdash;I mean
    cutlet."</p>

    <p>"No," she said.</p>

    <p>"Yes," I said, "and you can have all the rissoles."</p>

    <h3>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h3>

    <p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned
    Clerks.</i>)</p>

    <p><i>War and the Future</i> (CASSELL), by Mr. H.G. WELLS, is
    not a sustained thesis but just jets of comment and flashes of
    epigram about the War as he has seen it on the French, Italian
    and British fronts, and has thought about it in peaceful Essex.
    A characteristic opening chapter, "The Passing of the Effigy,"
    suggests that "the Kaiser is perhaps the last of that long
    series of crowned and cloaked and semi-divine personages which
    has included Caesar and Alexander and Napoleon the
    First&mdash;and Third. In the light of the new time we see the
    emperor-god for the guy he is." Generalissimo JOFFRE, on the
    other hand, he found to be a decent most capable man, without
    fuss and flummery, doing a distasteful job of work singularly
    well. There is some particularly interesting matter about
    aeroplane work, and the writer betrays a keen distress lest the
    cavalry notions of the soldiers of the old school should make
    them put their trust in the horsemen rather than the airmen in
    the break-through. As for "tanks," he offers the alternative of
    organised world control or a new warfare of mammoth landships,
    to which the devastation of this War will be merely sketchy;
    but I doubt if he quite makes his point here. And finally this
    swift-dreaming thinker proclaims a vision which he has seen of
    a new world-wide interrelated republicanism founded on a
    recognition of the over-lordship of God.... You put the book
    down feeling you have had a long, desultory and intimate
    conversation with a very interesting fellow-traveller.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Really, if Mr. ROBERT HICHENS continues his present
    spendthrift course, whatever Board controls the consumption of
    paper will have to put him on half rations. I believe that his
    literary health would benefit enormously by such a
    r&eacute;gime. This was my first thought in contemplating the
    almost six hundred pages of <i>In the Wilderness</i> (METHUEN),
    and it persists, strengthened now that I have turned the last,
    of them. Here is a direct and moving tragedy of three lives,
    much of the appeal of which is lost in a fog of superfluous
    words. Of its theme I will tell you only this, that it shows
    the contrasting loves, material and physical, of two widely
    divergent types of womanhood. Probably human nature, rather
    than Mr. HICHENS, should be blamed for the fact that the
    unmoral <i>Cynthia</i> is many times more interesting than the
    virtuous but slightly fatiguing <i>Rosamund</i>. The former is
    indeed far the most vital character in the tale, a figure none
    the less sinister for its clever touch of austerity. Possibly,
    however, her success is to some extent due to contrast; for
    certainly both <i>Rosamund</i> and <i>Dion</i>, the husband
    whom she alienated by her unforgiving nature, embody all the
    worst characteristics of Mr. HICHEN'S creations. Perhaps you
    know what I mean. Chiefly it is a matter of super-sensibility
    to surroundings, which renders them so fluid that often the
    scenery seems to push them about. It is this, coupled with the
    author's own lingering pleasure in a romantic setting, that
    delays the conflict, which is the real motive of the book, over
    long. But once this has come to grips the interest and the
    skill of it will hold you a willing captive to Mr. HICHENS at
    his best.</p>

    <p>Much as I have enjoyed some previous work by Baroness VON
    HUTTEN I am glad to say that I consider <i>Magpie</i>
    (HUTCHINSON) her best yet. It is indeed a long time since I
    read a happier or more holding story. The title is a punning
    one, as the heroine's name is really <i>Margaret Pye</i>, but I
    am more than willing to overlook this for the sake of the
    pleasantly-drawn young woman to whom it refers and the general
    interest of the tale. Briefly, this has two movements, one
    forward, which deals with the evolution of <i>Mag</i> from a
    fat, rather down-at-heel little carrier of washing into the
    charming young lady of the cover; the other retrospective, and
    concerned with the mystery of a wonderful artist who has
    disappeared before the story opens. I have no idea of clearing
    up, or even further indicating, this problem to you. But I will
    say that the secret is so adroitly kept that the perfect orgy
    of elucidation in the final chapter left me a little
    breathless. Of course the whole thing is a fairy tale, with a
    baker's dozen of glaring improbabilities; but I am much
    mistaken if you will enjoy it the less for that. A quaint
    personal touch, which (to anyone who does not recall the cast
    of <i>Pinkie and the Fairies</i> on its revival) might well
    seem an impertinence, produced in me the comfortable glow of
    superiority that rewards the well-informed. But I can assure
    Baroness VON HUTTEN that she is all wrong about the acting of
    that particular part.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>As it is not Mr. Punch's habit to admit reviews of
    periodical publications, I ought to say that the case of <i>The
    New Europe</i> (CONSTABLE), whose first completed volume lies
    before me, is exceptional. In thirty years' experience of
    journalism I never remember a paper containing so much
    "meat"&mdash;some of it pretty strong meat, too&mdash;in
    proportion to its size. In hardly a single week since its first
    issue in October last have I failed to find between its
    tangerine-coloured covers some article giving me information
    that I did not know before, or furnishing a fresh view of
    something with which I thought myself familiar. And I take it
    there are many other writers&mdash;and even, perhaps, some
    statesmen&mdash;who have enjoyed the same experience. Dr.
    SETON-WATSON and the accomplished collaborators who march under
    his orange oriflamme may not always convince us (I am not sure,
    for example, that <i>Austria est delenda</i> may prove the only
    or the best prescription for bringing freedom to the Jugo-Slavs
    of South-Eastern Europe), but they always furnish the reader
    with the facts enabling him to test their conclusions; and that
    in these times is a great merit. My own feeling is that if they
    had begun their concerted labours a few years earlier the War
    might never have happened; or at least we should have gone into
    it with a much more accurate notion of the real aims of the
    Central Powers, and a much better chance of quickly defeating
    them. The tragedies of Serbia and Roumania would almost
    certainly have been averted.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>I am unable to hold out much prospect that you will find
    <i>Frailty</i> (CASSELL) a specially enlivening book. The scope
    of Miss OLIVE WADSLEY'S story, sufficiently indicated by its
    title, does not admit of humorous relief. But it is both
    vigorous and vital. Certainly it seemed hard luck on <i>Charles
    Ley</i> that, after heroically curing himself of the drug
    habit, he should marry the girl of his choice only to find her
    a victim to strong drink. But of course, had this not happened,
    the "punch" of Miss WADSLEY'S tale would have been weakened by
    half. Do not, however, be alarmed; the author knows when to
    stop, and confines her awful examples to these two, thereby
    avoiding the error of Mrs. HENRY WOOD, who (you may recall)
    plunged the entire cast of <i>Danesbury House</i> into a flood
    of alcohol. Not that Miss WADSLEY herself lacks for courage;
    she can rise unusually to the demands of a situation, and I
    have seldom read chapters more moving of their kind than those
    that depict the gradual conquest of <i>Charles</i> by the
    cocaine fiend, and his subsequent struggle back to freedom.
    Here the "strong" writing seemed to me both natural and in
    place; ever so much more convincing therefore than when
    employed upon the love scenes. I have my doubts whether, even
    in this age of what I might call the trampling suitor, anyone
    was over quite so heavy-booted over the affair as was
    <i>Charles</i> when he carried off his chosen mate from a
    small-and-early in Grosvenor Square. Fortunately the other
    parts of the story are less melodramatic, and make it
    emphatically a book not to be missed.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Happy is the reviewer with a book which gives him so much
    delightful information that he tries to ration himself to so
    many pages per day. This is what I resolved to do with <i>In
    the Northern Mists</i> (HODDER AND STOUGHTON); but I could not
    keep to my resolution, so attractive was the fare. These
    sketches are the work of a Grand Fleet Chaplain, and are packed
    with wisdom from all the ages. If you haven't the luck to be a
    sailor you will learn a lot from this admirable theologian
    about the men and methods and the spirit of the Grand Fleet.
    His book fills me with pride; yet I dare not express it for
    fear of offending the notorious modesty of the senior service.
    So shy indeed is our Fleet of praise that I feel my apologies
    are due to their Chaplain for my perfectly honest commendation
    of his book. But he seems human enough to pardon the more
    venial sins.</p>

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
